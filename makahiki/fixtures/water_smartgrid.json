Every lounge is assigned a daily energy goal that represents a 5% reduction in electricity use from what the lounge was using before the competition. The Energy Goal Game shows how much energy your lounge has used so far today, and how that compares to the energy goal. The game also shows some activities that might be helpful in getting your lounge to reduce its energy use.\r\n\r\nFor this activity, you will check out the [Go Low](/energy) page. Read the page over, and come back to here and report three things: is your lounge above or below the energy goal, by how much, and name one activity that might help your lounge conserve energy."

To do this, you will need a large container with a known volume (like a water bottle or bucket) that you can fill in the shower, and a clock of some type (like your watch or cell phone). Make sure to not get your clock wet if it isn't waterproof!\r\n\r\nHold the container up to the shower head, turn on the shower faucet to the level you use normally when showering, and note the time on the clock (or use a stopwatch). Watch the container fill, and note the time when it is completely full of water.\r\n\r\nNow you know the volume of water that the shower put out, and the amount of time it was running. From these two values, you can compute the flow rate of your shower by dividing the volume by the number of seconds it took to fill. For example, if you filled a 1 gallon bucket and it took 30 seconds, then the flow rate is 2 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, water comes out of shower heads pretty fast, which is why it is important to turn off the water when you aren't actively using it, like while soaping up."

The art should have some relationship to the theme of the Kukui Cup: use your imagination. To receive credit for this activity, take a picture of it (preferably at night) and include some text describing what your art is about. The more amazing, creative, and energy-related your window art, the more points you can earn. Since you still want to save energy, we recommend that you light up your art between 9-9:15 PM, you don't need to keep it lit all night long.\r\n\r\nAnother way to get more points for this activity is to enlist your neighbors beside you, above you, or below you to create a coordinated group window art effort. Take a photo of all of the windows, then tell us in the description which one is yours.\r\n\r\nThe more awesome your art, the closer to 50 points you'll earn.\r\n"

For refrigerators, monitor their energy consumption for 30 minutes, then multiply by 48 to get an estimate of its total consumption for 24 hours. For microwaves, monitor its energy consumption during a 1 minute period, then multiply by the number of minutes per day that you and your roommate typically use it. Do the same for your other appliances: computer, Xbox, fans, etc.\r\n3. To receive credit for this activity, submit a list of the appliances in your room, your estimate of the energy each of them consume per day, and the total amount of energy your entire room uses per day (in watt-hours or kilowatt-hours). Remember to include an estimate for the overhead light if you use it. Are you surprised by this data?"

For every distinct wasting situation you find, we'll award 5 Canopy Karma points, up to 50 points. We'll also pass your list on the the appropriate people to try to get the wasting stopped!"

To do this, you will need a large container with a known volume (like a water bottle or bucket) that you can fit in the sink, and a clock of some type (like your watch or cell phone). Make sure to keep your clock dry if it isn't waterproof!\r\n\r\nHold the container up to the faucet in the sink, turn on the water to the level you use normally when using the sink, and note the time on the clock (or use a stopwatch). Watch the container fill, and note the time when it is completely full of water.\r\n\r\nNow you know the volume of water that the sink put out, and the amount of time it was running. From these two values, you can compute the flow rate of your sink by dividing the volume by the number of seconds it took to fill. For example, if you filled a 1 gallon bucket and it took 30 seconds, then the flow rate is 2 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, water comes out of faucets pretty fast, which is why it is important to turn off the water when you aren't actively using it, like while brushing your teeth."

Have an hour to walk around campus and learn about UH energy and sustainability projects? Then you're all set!\r\n\r\nHere's the deal: you'll use your smartphone (and your own smarts) to follow a trail of clues around campus and discover eight different locations related to energy or sustainability. Each location is tagged with a special Kukui Cup sign so you'll know when you've found it. Once there, take a picture of yourself with the sign in the background for verification, and upload to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/). You will earn 5 Kukui Cup points for each location you find.  The sign also contains a URL that you can retrieve to obtain directions to the next location.\r\n\r\nReady?  Here's the first clue (you'll want to open it on your smartphone): [http://goo.gl/psXER](http://goo.gl/psXER)\r\n\r\nWhen you are done, come back here, click **I Did This!** and provide us with a link to your Flickr account so we can verify your trek."

This activity is worth a variable number of points, so the more effort and the higher quality of your interview, the more points you will receive.\r\n\r\nSome possible interview subjects:\r\n\r\n* School administrators (Facilities Management, Sustainability Corps)\r\n* School faculty\r\n* Local environmental organizations (Blue Planet Foundation, Kanu Hawaii, Surfrider Foundation)\r\n* Local politicians (City Council, State Legislature, Congressional delegation)\r\n* Local industry (First Wind, solar installation companies)\r\n* Local government (DBEDT energy office, PUC)\r\n\r\nYou will have to find someone to interview, figure out what questions you want to ask them in advance, and then go interview them. You will probably want to record your interview so that you can refer to it later, but make sure you ask your subject if recording them is OK!\r\n\r\nYour resulting interview can be written (like you might see in a magazine), and audio recording, or even a video. Note that making a quality audio and video interview is quite challenging, so make sure you know what you are getting into."

Go to the [Flickr Kukui Cup 2011 Photo Chain Game group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/kukuicup-2011-photo-chain-game/). See what photo is at the end of the list.\r\n2. Take a photo of yourself in a way that extends the chain (match either the pose, location, or item)\r\n3. Upload your photo to your own Flickr account (creating it if necessary).\r\n4. Go back to the [Flickr Kukui Cup 2011 Photo Chain Game group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/kukuicup-2011-photo-chain-game/), and \"join\" the group. \r\n5. Click \"Add Photos\" and select your photo. \r\n6. Provide a title, such as \"Photo Chain Game 12\" (or whatever the next number is in the chain).\r\n7. Provide a caption that indicates: pose, location, item, and which of the three matches.\r\n8. Save.\r\n9. Click **I Did This!** button and tell us your Flickr name so we can confirm your upload to the group and award your points."

            "description": "This activity is an opportunity to creatively explore one of the topics of the Kukui Cup in more depth. For this activity, you will make a **video** on the subject of one of the categories from the Smart Grid such as energy, lighting, transportation and post it on YouTube. Note that this activity will require significantly more effort than normal activities, but it is also worth more points. This activity is worth a variable number of points, so the more effort and the higher quality of your video, the more points you will receive.\r\n\r\nMaking a interesting video can be hard work. You'll find it much easier if you write out a little \"screenplay\" beforehand and think about what you want to communicate. YouTube has a [Handbook](http://www.youtube.com/t/yt_handbook_produce) with lots of great tips on making videos. Points will be awarded based on your video's originality, quality, and impact. For example, you talking into your webcam will get fewer points than visualizing your points with images or outdoor video. Make sure you mention the Kukui Cup either in your video or in the description field. When your video is ready, you can submit the URL for verification and scoring.\r\n\r\n*When submitting a video created by a group of players, please let us know how many people are planning to submit the video for points so we can divide the credit.*"

All you need to do is have the new user enter your email address on the new \"Referral Bonus\" page during their initial login.   Both you and they will earn 10 extra points as soon as the new user earns 30 points with regular game play. There is **NO LIMIT** to the number of times you can earn a referral bonus, so start signing up your friends now!\r\n\r\nTo help you get started, you can earn five extra points for one of your referrals by completing this activity. Just type in the email address of the new user you brought to the Kukui Cup in the box below. You will get your five points after the new user gets to 30 points.\r\n\r\nNote that while this activity is just a one-shot deal, the referral bonus feature that it introduces you to can be done repeatedly.  You do not have to wait for your first referral to complete before getting new referrals.   Nor do you have to even do this activity at all in order to get referral bonuses.  So, go out there, get as many new players to sign up and enter your email as possible, and you will get 10 points each time they achieve 30 points.  (You can even coach them through their first 30 points to make sure they get a proper introduction to the game).    "
